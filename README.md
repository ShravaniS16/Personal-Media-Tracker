# Personal-Media-Tracker
Personal Media Tracker is a command-line application to manage movie and book lists. Users can add, display, remove, and track completed items. It uses linked lists to store Watchlist, Readlist, and Deleted List, allowing efficient management of media items with options to clear or delete entries.

## Features
- **Add Media**: Add movies to your Watchlist or books to your Readlist.
- **Display Lists**: View the items currently in your Watchlist and Readlist.
- **Remove Completed Media**: Move completed movies and books to the Completed List.
- **Delete Items**: Remove items from the lists entirely.
- **Clear Lists**: Clear the Watchlist or Readlist for a fresh start.

## Data Structures
The project uses three linked lists:
1. **Watchlist**: Stores movies you intend to watch.
2. **Readlist**: Stores books you plan to read.
3. **DeletedList**: Tracks items you've completed or removed.
